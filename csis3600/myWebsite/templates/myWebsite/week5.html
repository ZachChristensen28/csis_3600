    <h3 class="no-margin-bottom"><i class="fal fa-pencil"></i> 1. Define the following:</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>Demand paging</dt>
      <dd>the operating system copies a disk page into physical memory only if an attempt is made to access it and that page is not already in memory.</dd>
      <dt>Job Table</dt>
      <dd>A table of Jobs</dd>
      <dt>Page map table</dt>
      <dd>A page table is the data structure used by a virtual memory system in a computer operating system to store the mapping between virtual addresses and physical addresses. Virtual addresses are used by the program executed by the accessing process,
        while physical addresses are used by the hardware, or more specifically, by the RAM subsystem.</dd>
      <dt>Memory map table</dt>
      <dd>Indicates how memory is laid out.</dd>
      <dt>Virtual memory</dt>
      <dd>Is a memory management technique that provides an "idealized abstraction of the storage resources that are actually available on a given machine</dd>
      <dt>Page Frame</dt>
      <dd>Is a fixed-length contiguous block of virtual memory, described by a single entry in the page table. </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>Program Counter</dt>
      <dd>Holds the address of the next instruction to be executed, while the instruction register (IR) holds the encoded instruction. </dd>
      <dt>Page Fault</dt>
      <dd>A page fault is a type of exception raised by computer hardware when a running program accesses a memory page that is not currently mapped by the memory management unit into the virtual address space of a process.</dd>
      <dt>Working set</dt>
      <dd>Defines the amount of memory that a process requires in a given time interval.</dd>
      <dt>Segmentation Fault</dt>
      <dd>Is a fault, or failure condition, raised by hardware with memory protection, notifying an operating system the software has attempted to access a restricted area of memory.</dd>
      <dt>Page replacement policy</dt>
      <dd>Page replacement algorithms decide which memory pages to page out, sometimes called swap out, or write to disk, when a page of memory needs to be allocated.</dd>

    <dl>
      <dt>fstab</dt>

      <dt>group</dt>
      <dd>Lists the groups on the machine</dd>
      <dt>hosts</dt>
      <dd>Contains the host database</dd>
      <dt>inittab</dt>
      <dd>Describes which processes are started at bootup and during normal operation</dd>

      <dt>profile</dt>
